<p>What factors impact the comprehensibility of code? In this blog post, I'll
describe an experiment I did with my advisors <a href="http://osl.iu.edu/~lums/">Andrew
Lumsdaine</a> (Computer Science) and <a href="http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/rgoldsto/">Rob
Goldstone</a> (Cognitive Science) at
Indiana University.</p>
<p>We asked 162 programmers to predict the output of <a href="../pages/eyecode-programs.html">10 small Python
programs</a>.  Each program had 2 or 3 different
versions, and we used subtle differences between program versions to
demonstrate that seemingly insignificant notational changes can have big
effects on correctness and response times. I'll go over some of the results
here, hopefully to whet your appetite for <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5257">the
paper</a>.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2 id="the-programmers">The Programmers</h2>
<p>We had 162 programmers (129 males, 30 females, 3 unreported) participate from
Amazon's Mechanical Turk (130 people), the local Bloomington, IN area (29
people), and via e-mail solicitations (3 people). All participants needed to
have some programming experience, and the Mechanical Turkers were required to
pass a simple Python quiz before taking the experiment.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the participant demographics:
<img alt="Demographics" src="../assets/img/plot-demographics.png"></p>
<p>We paid the local participants $10 each because they also had to come in to the
lab and do the experiment in from of an eye-tracker (see my <a href="modeling-how-programmers-read-code.html">previous
post</a> for a video). The folks from
Mechanical Turk got $0.75, which is a lot more than the penny I see most people
offering for surveys!</p>
<h2 id="the-experiment">The Experiment</h2>
<p>The experiment consisted of a pre-test survey, 10 trials (one program each),
and a post-test survey. The pre-test survey gathered information about the
participant's age, gender, education, and experience. Participants were then
asked to predict the printed output of <a href="../pages/eyecode-programs.html">10 short Python
programs</a>, one version randomly chosen from
each of our program base types.</p>
<p>Here's a shot of the main screen that participants used to drill down into each
trial:</p>
<p><img alt="Main Screen" src="../assets/img/eyecode_home.png"></p>
<p>An individual trial consisted of the program's code (unhighlighted) and a text
box where the participant could write what they thought the program would
output.</p>
<p><img alt="Main Screen" src="../assets/img/eyecode_trial.png"></p>
<p>The presentation order and names of the programs were randomized, and all
answers were final (i.e., no going back).  Although every program actually ran
without errors, participants were not informed of this fact beforehand. The
post-test survey gauged a participant's confidence in their answers and the
perceived difficulty of the task.</p>
<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<p>We collected a total of 1,602 trials from the 162 participants starting
November 20, 2012 and ending January 19, 2013. Trials were graded
semi-automatically using a custom grading script (<a href="https://github.com/synesthesiam/eyecode-tools">available
here</a>). Grades were assigned like this:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Perfect (10 points)</strong> - response exactly matched the program's output
  (about 63% of trials)</li>
<li><strong>Correct (7-9 points)</strong> - response had the right numbers or letters, but
  incorrect formatting (e.g., wrong whitespace, commas, brackets)</li>
<li><strong>Common error (2-4 points)</strong> - response was incorrect, but given by at least
  3 other participants</li>
</ul><p>All other responses were graded manually (about 12% of the trials). Any trial
that was restarted was discarded. This only happened, though, if the
participant reloaded the web page or fiddled with the URL to try and change
their answer.</p>
<p>We had a total of <a href="../pages/eyecode-programs.html">25 Python programs in 10 different
categories</a>. These programs were designed to be
understandable by a wide audience, and therefore did not touch on Python
features outside of a first or second introductory programming course. This
worked out great for our eye-tracking experiment because we got a lot of
examples of programmers successfully comprehending a program and predicting its
output.  The programs were probably a bit too easy, though, as evidenced by the
large number of perfect trials (62%). If we add in correct grades (minor
formatting errors), that figure rises to 73%. This made it tough to distinguish
experienced programmers from inexperienced programmers using grades alone.</p>
<p><!--The programs ranged in size from 3 to 24 lines of code (LOC).  Additional-->

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Because this is a blog post, I'll only be discussing a handful of the results.
I'll also stick with graphical comparsions, and try to avoid talking about
stats. If you want all of that stuff, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5257">the
paper</a> is chock full of it!</p>
<h3 id="whitespace-and-loops">Whitespace and Loops</h3>
<p>The <a href="../pages/eyecode-programs.html#counting">counting</a> program had two versions
that differed only their whitespace. Here's the "nospace" version:</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">"The count is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">"Done counting"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When run, this program produces the following output:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>The count is 1
Done counting
The count is 2
Done counting
The count is 3
Done counting
The count is 4
Done counting
</pre></div>


<p>To most people, this is clearly a bug -- "Done counting" should probably only
be printed once at the end. Nevertheless, this is what the program says to do.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at the "twospaces" version:</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">"The count is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span>

    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">"Done counting"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This version had two blank lines (vertical spaces) between the print
statements.  The meaning of the program doesn't change in Python, but we saw a
big change in the distribution of grades.</p>
<p><img alt="counting grade distribution" src="../assets/img/grade_pie-counting.png"></p>
<p>In the "nospace" version, 75% of the participants got the answer correct
character-for-character (perfect). If we include minor formatting mistakes
(correct), that figure rises another 8%. Contrast this with the "twospaces"
version, where more than twice as many people guessed the following (wrong)
output:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>The count is 1
The count is 2
The count is 3
The count is 4
Done counting
</pre></div>


<p>We were even more surprised to find that years of Python experience didn't
see to make a difference in the odds of making this mistake. Perhaps Python
could do with a required <code>end</code> token?</p>
<h3 id="expect-the-unexpected">Expect the Unexpected</h3>
<p>What do you suppose this program outputs?</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">twice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span>

<span class="n">added</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">add_1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">added</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">twice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">added</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">add_1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">added</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">twice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">added</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">added</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you're like half of the programmers in our experiment, you answered <code>22</code>.
Take another look, and you'll realize that <code>add_1()</code> and <code>twice()</code> don't
actually return anything. The main body also doesn't reassign anything to the
<code>added</code> variable. This means that <code>added</code> retains its initial value, making the
final result just <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>Why did 50% of our participants get this program wrong? There is a strong
expectation amongst programmers that you <em>don't include code that won't be
used</em>. Elliot Soloway identified this and other maxims (or <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/inf233-FQ07/oldpapers/SollowayEhrlich.pdf">rules of
discourse</a>)
in 1984. Like conversational norms, these unwritten rules can have a powerful
influence on interpretation.</p>
<p>Many modern editors will warn about unused local variables, but this seems to be
something more. The <code>add_1()</code> and <code>twice()</code> functions don't really <em>do</em>
anything, even though they assign a new value to <code>num</code>. It may be useful to
quantify how programmers differentiate between functions that do things and
functions that don't in order to provide better warnings.</p>
<h3 id="reading-between-the-lines">Reading <code>between</code> the Lines</h3>
<p>The longest program in our study was
<a href="../pages/eyecode-programs.html#between">between</a>. It filtered down two lists,
printed the results, and then printed the intersection of the (original) two
lists. We had two versions, "functions" and "inline", where the filtering and
intersection operations were either contained in separate functions or inlined
in the main body.</p>
<p>We didn't see a big difference in grades or response times, though about 10%
more participants gave a correct answer on the "inline" version. There was,
however, an interesting common error that more experienced programmers tended
to make.  Here's the code for the "inline" version:</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">x_between</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x_i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">x_i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x_i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">x_between</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x_i</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">x_between</span>

<span class="n">y_between</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">y_i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">y_i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y_i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">y_between</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y_i</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">y_between</span>

<span class="n">xy_common</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x_i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x_i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">xy_common</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x_i</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">xy_common</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The correct output is this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>[8, 7, 9]
[1, 0, 8, 1]
[8, 9, 0]
</pre></div>


<p>but about 22% of our participants gave this answer instead:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>[8, 7, 9]
[1, 0, 8, 1]
[8]
</pre></div>


<p>This would be the right answer if the intersection (common) operation was
performed on the filtered lists instead of the original lists. Curiously, the
average experience level in the mistaken 22% was a good bit higher than in the
overall group.  We hypothesized that this may represent another "rule of
discourse" -- <em>later computations should follow from earlier ones</em>.</p>
<p>More experienced programmers may be expecting the intersection, which comes
later than the filtering, to make use of the filtered lists. We think that
moving the intersection before the filtering operations would eliminate the
error, but we're interested to hear what changes others think would help
programmers avoid this mistake.</p>
